Our project is PC Automate. This site is based on an useful idea in a way in which users will be able  to find and buy customized computer of their choices much easier as compared to other tools on the internet, even though there are numerous number of websites which help users to get customized machines of their choices but after analyzing we found that they hardly upload or add new products. Which is not the case on our site. In this website we basically have 3 modules. The first module contains the admin module, the second module contains the builder’s module who will be responsible to customize the parts and last but not least the third module contains the user's point of view. Who will login as a client and will be able to find the products of their needs.

Building your own PC and need thoughts on where to get everything rolling? Investigate our  construct guides which cover a variety of system products and are in your budget. We also provide desktops which are completely customized by our skilled engineers according to the user's needs. Here are the key features of the website:
* Wide varieties of computer parts available in the website
* Make your own PC templates and share it with your friends.
* A shop for Headphones, Keyboards etc…
* Build guides available (suggestions about latest technology and parts available in the market) 
* You can get discounts if you are a custom builder.
